Author                  : RVCC (Re-Volt Customs Creations), dedicated
			  to bringing only the best into Re-Volt.

Description		: We made this car to keep the other cool
			  R/C cars out there company, like Kukri, the
			  Dedications and Race Debate packs, CAT 2000,
			  etc.  We also wanted to try some new things
			  and they all worked and ended up pretty cool.

			  This is the most realistic R/C car for
			  Re-Volt so far.  Here are some of its very
			  cool and most realistic features: a very
			  detailed chassis model with removable (and
			  replace-able) body, A-arms, realistic and
			  innovative shocks with springs you can see
			  through, a set of "Stock Class" parameters,
			  a set of "Modified Class" parameters, etc.
			  It also comes with 4 separate skins, so you
			  can choose your favorite or even make your
			  own, maybe just like your real R/C truck.
			  The removable body is mapped to the right
			  half of the bmp, so you can make your own
			  3d body (using a 3d program like 3ds MAX
			  or Zmodeler, which is FREE) and use it on
			  the chassis if you wish.  The mapping can
			  be done easily to the right half
			  with no worries of conflicting with other
			  models.  This is a very versatile base
			  and we plan on releasing a buggy version
			  in the next little while, so keep your eyes
			  open for it.  I hope you enjoy this truck
			  as much a we do.

			**All 9 models used for this car were made
			  by CADster; the default "RVCC" skin, 
			  car3.bmp & car4.bmp made by Nickki1; and
			  Nairb painted car2.bmp (just like his real
			  R/C Truck) and made both sets of parameters.**

Optional features	: In case the "Stock" version isn't racy enough
			  for ya, we've included some "Modified" parameters.
			  Just like real R/C racing, most settings are
			  the same, but it has a hotter motor and the
			  suspension is tweaked just a little differently.
			  The Stock parameters are the default, but it's
			  simple to use the others.  Just delete the
			  parameters.txt file (the Stock Parameters.txt
			  is the backup) and copy the Modified parameters
			  and rename it to parameters.txt.
			  
Additional Credits to	: We owe SO MUCH to these guys for all the great
			  help they gave us about making shocks and axles
			  (etc.) in 3DS MAX: RiffRaff, LaserBeams,
			  Major Clod, and Antimorph.  We also need to thank
			  Ali (TGA, that is), SuperTard, Wayne LeMonds, PartzMan, 
			  BurnRubr and any others I'm forgetting ATM for their
			  continuing efforts to improve our Re-Volting
			  experiences.  Thanks so much for your hard work
			  and innovation!  You've all helped us willingly
			  and patiently no matter how many times we asked
			  you for your (much needed) help.  Thanks a TON,
			  guys.  You ROCK!  This creation (and many others
			  coming up) would not have come to fruition if it
			  were not for your help.  We appreciate you guys
			  BIG TIME!  :^)  This is dedicated to you all!
			  Isn't our tight litte RV community GREAT!?

**Updates!!**		: Since everybody was thinking they were getting
			  4 separate cars when this first came out and
			  were dissapointed when it was actually one truck
			  with three extra skins, I decided to make a new
			  zip file that would give you four complete cars
			  automatically.  All you need to do is unzip the
			  file right to your Re-Volt folder and everything
			  will be put in place automatically.  Each truck
			  has its own stock and modified parameters (which
			  have beed tweaked slightly), so changing class
			  should be easy.  Enjoy!!
