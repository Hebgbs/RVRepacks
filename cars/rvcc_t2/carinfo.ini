Description=We made this car to keep the other cool R/C cars out there company, like Kukri, the Dedications and Race Debate packs, CAT 2000, etc.  We also wanted to try some new things and they all worked and ended up pretty cool.  This is the most realistic R/C car for Re-Volt so far.  |Here are some of its very cool and most realistic features: a very detailed chassis model with removable (and replace-able) body, A-arms, realistic and innovative shocks with springs you can see through, a set of "Stock Class" parameters, a set of "Modified Class" parameters, etc. It also comes with 4 separate skins, so you can choose your favorite or even make your own, maybe just like your real R/C truck.  The removable body is mapped to the right half of the bmp, so you can make your own 3d body (using a 3d program like 3ds MAX or Zmodeler, which is FREE) and use it on the chassis if you wish.  The mapping can be done easily to the right half with no worries of conflicting with other models.  This is a very versatile base and we plan on releasing a buggy version in the next little while, so keep your eyes open for it.  I hope you enjoy this truck as much a we do.||**All 9 models used for this car were made by CADster; the default skin, car3.bmp & car4.bmp made by Nickki1; and Nairb painted car2.bmp (just like his real R/C Truck) and made both sets of parameters.**||RVCC, dedicated to bringing only the best into Re-Volt.
