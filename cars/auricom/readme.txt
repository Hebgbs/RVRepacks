+ Second Repaint of the wipeout         + 
+ project.                              + 
+ 
                                      + 
+ 
Auricom is a North American based     + 
+ company in the Wipeout series, and    + 
+ thus the theme and colour scheme      + 
+ reflects this. Within the wipeout     + 
+ games, Auricom has a high shield      + 
+ rating, and as such I've increased    + 
+ Auricom's weight so it takes less     + 
+ "damage" from projectiles. It has a   + 
+ higher top speed and weight than      + 
+ the stock Dust Mite, but has a        + 
+ lower accelarion to balance it out.   + 
+ 
                                      + 
+ 
Auricom also has a modified spring    + 
+ system. The front wheels have a       + 
+ very low stiffness (150) setting,     + 
+ but the real wheels have a much       + 
+ stronger spring (being at 500) This   + 
+ makes Auricom's front end lower       + 
+ than it's back, and it results in a   + 
+ meaner, more agressive stance.        + 
+ Coupled with it's weight, this        + 
+ changes the overall handling, a       + 
+ little slippery at high speeds but    + 
+ otherwise fairly stable.              + 
+ 
                                      + 
+ 
This car also comes with an           + 
+ Advanced parameter setting. It's      + 
+ only for fun and may not be as        + 
+ fine-tuned as teh Rookie Parameter    + 
+ setting.                              + 
+ 
                                      + 
+ 
AI Wise- Auricom does really well     + 
+ on icy tracks. Tracks with few        + 
+ corners and little hills also         + 
+ benefit from Auircom's higher than    + 
+ average speed. (Rookie only)          +
