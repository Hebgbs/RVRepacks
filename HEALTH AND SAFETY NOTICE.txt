Mouse's wheels and Candy Pebbles' axel has been specially modified to play (somewhat) nicely with all textures. Other modifications include the hull, which is also from the R6, only repositioned to work with the higher wheelbase.

The wheels are a bit buggy, as the UV map isn't playing nice to remove the gradiation that doesn't exist on Mouse's wheels, but that is entirely forgiveable considering what I'm asking the game to render. Also, the aerial had been repositioned to be smack in the middle of the roof to prevent the odd clipping issues seen while in use.
