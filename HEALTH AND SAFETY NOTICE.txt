TOYECA XT REPACK

Stock vehicle Toyeca is the root vehicle.
If modified, changes will be reflected for the following:
\ToyecaXT_B
\ToyecaXT_G
\ToyecaXT_R

Reasons for repack:
They're a bunch of skins for Toyeca with souped-up parameters. As the root
vehicle, I figured repacking them like this would work, and guess what?

Repack modifications:
Parameters for the newly-created Toyeca XT (Red), Toyeca XT (Green) and
Toyeca XT (Blue) were modified to reflect file locations for Toyeca, save
the TPAGE which was modified with the supplied car.bmp in each folder.

Otherwise, the parameters have been untouched. Since it's based off a stock
car, I also included Citywalker's Toyeca AI for users capable of utilizing it.

The cars were originally called collectively "toyxtpack" but I fixed the names
up so they all have unique identification.

Other things you can do:
Change the EnvRGB of each car's parameters so they have different-colored
"Shine" to them -- Red for red, blue for blue and green for green, or some
variation thereof.

Update 1: Fixed parameters.
Update 2: Copied Purp XL's shadow settings, knowing Purp XL is practically identical to Toyeca.

Instructions:
Simply copy \cars.
