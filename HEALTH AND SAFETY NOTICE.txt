Considering there are five sets in each color, that's 115 cars this pack comes with. Every car has a carbox to go with it!*3 Great for battle tag, competitive play or whatever other ideas you might have that modifies the metagame of Re-Volt. APPLY PRIMARY SET FIRST by copying /cars over before using any of the contents in /altparams to further modify the contents.

*1 - Modified stock body models come with the set, if you don't like those copy the contents of the /gencarfixes folder in /altparams to your installation. In doing so, the original gancar models become part of the common respirce in /cars once again, while the repaints use the modified body models.

*2 - Carbox? What carbox? Mouse doesn't need a carbox! Actually, Mouse never had a carbox, which is why the stock box graphic is used instead.

*3 - Carboxes for Drone were incomplete, thusly they never were used in the arcade, nor were they intended to be used with the drone cars in the select screen.

*4 - UFO repaints do NOT fly. If you want it flying, look in /altparams to make that magic happen.
