DEDICATIONS REPACK

\Dedications is the root vehicle.
Do not remove it, or the following will no longer function as intended;
\DediCyb
\DedigP
\DediICE
\DediTrips
\DediZag

Reason for repack:
The batch file was rather cumbersome and unnecessary.
For people considering the dedications repack on RVL, this is the same thing.

The batch file basically performed a bunch of copy operations that moved
specific files and renamed them to work in Re-Volt.

Repack modifications:
Parameter files for Cyber, Tiamait, Mr. Freeze, Triple 6s and Zig-Zag have been
modified to reflect file locations used by Antimorph in \Dedications, which is the
root vehicle for everything else that came with it.

The redundant PRM files for these five vehicles were no longer necessary, therefore
they have been removed.

It goes without saying the batch file inst.bat has been removed.

Update 1: Fixed parameters.

Update 2: Added shadows for each car.

Instructions:
Simply copy \cars.
